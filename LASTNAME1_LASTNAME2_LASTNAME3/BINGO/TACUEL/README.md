# Act 6 Major Output
> As discussed last meeting. Here are the details to our final output.

## BINGO!

* Have a group (max 3 members) and create a BINGO app using Java Swing.
* The BINGO app can automatically change its number content based on the following rules:

   - B features numbers 1 – 15
   - I features numbers 16 – 30
   - N features numbers 31 – 45
   - G features numbers 46 – 60
   - O features numbers 61 – 75
   - No repeating numbers.
   - Sequences are randomly generated.
* The BINGO app will be mainly composed of **JButtons** containing the numbers which gets disabled when clicked/pressed.
* The BINGO app must be accompanied by a **UML class diagram** and must mirror all the components in the app.
* The group can add additional features or functionalities to the app for extra points.
* Use of Stack-overflow and code sharing is highly recommended provided that the team give source credits to the code snippets.
* Submit your output via PR and follow the example directory in this repository (name format and structure).
* Excess points will be transferred to class participation.
