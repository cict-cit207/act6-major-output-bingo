Bingo App README
This README provides instructions on how to run the Bingo App. The code is organized into three classes: BingoApp, StartFrame, and CardFrame, along with a utility class GenerateNumbers.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
Ensure that the required images are available at the specified paths or update the paths accordingly.

Running the App
1. Compile the Code:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
Compile the code using the command: 
CODE: javac BingoApp.java

2. Run the Application:
Run the compiled program with the following command: 
CODE: java BingoApp
This will launch the Bingo App, and the main menu will appear.

3. Main Menu:
The main menu allows you to choose between two options:
Generate Random Card: Click the "Generate Random Card" button to generate a random bingo card.
Create Own Card:
Click the "Create Own Card" button to create a custom bingo card.

4. Generate Random Card:
Upon clicking "Generate Random Card," a new window will open with a randomly generated bingo card. The numbers on the card can be marked by clicking on them.

5. Create Own Card:
Clicking "Create Own Card" will open a window where you can input numbers for each bingo column (B, I, N, G, O). Follow the instructions and click "Generate Card" to create a custom bingo card.

6. Playing the Game:
In the bingo card window, you can click on the numbers to mark them. The "Roll" button generates a random letter (B, I, N, G, O) and number combination.

7. Resetting or Going Back:
The "Generate New Card" button in the bingo card window resets the card, while the "Back" button in both windows returns to the main menu.

NOTE
Make sure to replace the image paths in the code with the correct paths on your system if they differ.
The app uses Nimbus Look and Feel, so the UI may have a different appearance depending on your system.

Enjoy playing Bingo!
